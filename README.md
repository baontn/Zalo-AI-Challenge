# Zalo-AI-Challenge
This repository contains the code and dataset for the Bremen Big data challenge 2019. The code includes the model using Transfer learning with Inception, an util file, and a model that I built by myself.

## Problem description: 

During the Covid-19 outbreak, the Vietnamese government pushed the "5K" public health safety message. In the message, masking and keeping a safe distance are two key rules that have been shown to be extremely successful in preventing people from contracting or spreading the virus. Enforcing these principles on a large scale is where technology may help.

In this challenge, you will create algorithm to detect whether or not a person or group of individuals in a picture adhere to the "mask" and "distance" standards.  
Sample image can be seen below:

## Data Description:  

### Data Train:  

Inside the train.zip, you can find the following:  

* images: folder stores image file  

* train_meta.csv file: includes 5 columns:  

image_id: id of image  
fname: filename of image  
mask: mask label  
distancing: distance label  
5k: meet both conditions of mask and distancing  
 
Please note that there are some missing labels in the training dataset.   

### Data Public Test:  

Inside the public_test.zip, you can find the following:  

* images: folder stores list image files (jpg)  

* public_test_meta.csv file: includes 2 columns:  

image_id: id of image  
fname: filename of image  

In the private test you can find the same thing in the Private Test file.   

## Data Inspection: 

#### Describe the dataset:

It can be observed that there are 4175 images in the train dataset, there were a lot of missing labels. The number of missing labels were:

I will only use fully labeled data for my models, and compensate the lack of data by data augmentation.
